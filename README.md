## pHBBtoolbox: Tools for creating digital soil property maps and to derive lime prescription maps for site-specific soil acidity management.
> The "pH" package provides a set of algorithms and tools to implement site-specific liming in Brandenburg (Germany). The required lime (CaO) demand of arable mineral soils is calculated according to the framework scheme provided by the
> Association of German Agricultural Analytic and Research Institutes (VDLUFA). The package also contains an improved stepless approach (Ruehlmann et al., 2021) of the VDLUFA look-up table system and provides the instruments
> required to easily perform the steps necessary to build a complete precision liming processing chain. It comprises functions for: (1) sensor data interpolation, (2) optimal soil sampling, (3) soil mapping and
> (4) the development of prescription maps for variable rate (VRT) liming.
